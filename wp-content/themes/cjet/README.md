INN Learn WordPress Theme
===

This is the WordPress child theme used for https://learn.inn.org.

The user-facing name of the theme is `INN Learn`, but all of the theme internals and functions are still under the orignal name `cjet` (Community Journalism Executive Training).

As this is a child theme, it depends on the Largo parent theme which you can grab from: https://github.com/INN/Largo.
